                Hello! I'm Colin O'Brien, a freshman at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
                I love working with both software and hardware, and am fascinated by new and emerging technologies of all kinds.
                I'm a passionate problem solver, and enjoy working collaboratively with others towards a common goal. 
                In my free time, I enjoy reading about history and playing the bass in my band.
